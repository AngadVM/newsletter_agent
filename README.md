## Workflow
The project follows a structured pipeline using LangGraph:

1. **Vector ETL Process**
   - Runs the `vector-etl` CLI tool with a configuration file to extract and load data from Stack Overflow into the ChromaDB vector database.
   - Executed through the `run_vector_etl` function.

2. **Newsletter Generation**
   - Uses the `NewsletterGraph` component to generate a newsletter from the processed data.
   - Executed through the `run_newsletter` function.

3. **Email Dispatch**
   - Sends the generated newsletter HTML file to the configured recipients.
   - Uses SendGrid SMTP service for reliable email delivery.
   - Executed through the `run_email_sender` function.

The entire workflow is orchestrated in a LangGraph pipeline where each step is executed sequentially.
